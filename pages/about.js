            Journeymxn is a web-based platform that aggregates up-to-date labor trend data, vocational/trade/skill-based career programs, and matches student profiles that are generated after an assessment quiz with a comprehensive roadmap that can use to explore different options.

            We plan to create a service that will function as an interactive quiz that will aggregate the data into our database. This data will then be visualized using charts, viewable only by the sponsor and other administrators for our initial version. This initial version will be completed by the end of this course and will be demoed to the faculty and our sponsor. We aim for the initial software to be deployed and tested by the Long Beach Unified School District. We will provide them with data to help educate students on the variety of career paths outside of a four year degree.
